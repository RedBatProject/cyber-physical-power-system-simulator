Notes on the Simulator

1. Simulator Compatibility  
   - The simulator is currently designed to work specifically with the 118-bus network.  
   - It *can* function with other networks, but those implementations are not yet completed or tested.  

2. Directory Structure  
   - There is a folder named "working_on_118", which includes sample data for the 118-bus network.  
   - For detailed information about these samples, refer to Chapter 4 of the thesis.

3. Edges Data  
   - The file "EDGES.py" contains data used for reproducibility.  
   - It has pre-generated datasets for removing edges, with probabilities ranging from 0% to 100%.  
   - For each probability level, about 400 samples were generated randomly.  

4. Key Code Information in "main.py"  
   - At line 31 in "main.py", the command  
     "python
     Sample_Edge = Edges[1:5:1, 1::25]
     "  
     - The range "1:5:1" corresponds to probabilities [5%, 10%, 15%, 20%].  
     - The step "1::25" reduces the total samples from 400 to 20 by selecting every 25th sample.  
     - You can modify these ranges or steps as needed to test different configurations.  

5. Variables "renew" and "renew2"  
   - In "main.py", there are two adjustable variables: "renew" and "renew2".  
   - These variables control:  
     - "renew": The amount of available capacity.  
     - "renew2": The number of potential nodes (buses).  
   - Modify these values to explore alternative setups or scenarios.
